I am currently a senior R&D engineer at the Department of Computer Vision Technology (VIS), Baidu Inc., China. I received the B.E. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, and the M.S. degree from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. My current research mainly focuses on computer vision and image processing, with specific interests in multi-object tracking.

I am currently a senior R&D engineer at the Department of Computer Vision Technology (VIS), Baidu Inc., China. I received the B.E. degree and the M.S. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and The Chinese University of Hong Kong, seperately. My current research mainly focuses on computer vision, with specific interests in multi-object tracking and object detecion.
